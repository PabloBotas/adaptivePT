# Adaptive Proton Therapy

This code adapts the energy of the spots/layers in an attempt to keep planned dosages.

Patient geometry may change due to positioning or weight loss. Adaptive therapy is then desired to correct these effects in a daily basis. The code reads a patient directory structure as given by MCAuto-Astroid to get the necessary treatment parameters.
